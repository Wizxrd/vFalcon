## Overview
Falcon is a real-world FAA replay system used to track the manipulation of datablocks, aircraft positions, and other sector-specific data within the National Airspace System (NAS).
It typically includes recorded audio, including landline communications, and is used for post-event reviews such as traffic analysis, close call investigations, and training debriefs.

vFalcon is a replay and analysis system designed for Vatsim. It tracks datablock manipulation, aircraft movement across the virtual National Airspace System (vNAS).
While inspired by the FAA's real-world Falcon tool, vFalcon is built with modern flexibility in mind and does not include audio playback due to Vatsim limitations.

The primary use of vFalcon is for reviewing busy traffic scenarios, debriefing close calls, evaluating controller performance, and assisting in student training from live network situations. 
Unlike the real-world system which is likely to be outdated or limited, vFalcon is designed to be more intuitive, and potentially more powerful.
